# Let's go more in details about Monitoring

## **1. How can you check what are the most memory intensive running processes ?**

You can use 2 types of commands:

```sh
top
```

It will display a dynamic real-time view of the running processes. 
By default, it sorts processes by CPU usage, but you can change it to sort by memory usage by pressing Shift + M. This will reorder the processes with the highest memory usage at the top.

```sh
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head
```

It will lists all processes sorted by memory usage, with the most memory-intensive processes displayed at the top. It uses the -%mem flag to sort by memory usage percentage.

## **2. What are log files? Where can you fin them on a typical Linux system ?**

Log files are files that contain records of events, actions, and messages generated by the operating system, system services, applications, and other software running on a computer system. These records are often used for troubleshooting, system monitoring, and security auditing.

#### On a typical Linux system, log files are typically found in the /var/log directory. Here are some common log files and their purposes:

- **_syslog_**: The syslog file (/var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages on some systems) contains messages from the system and system-related services, such as the kernel, daemons, and various system utilities.

- **_auth.log_**: This file (/var/log/auth.log) contains authentication-related messages, including login attempts, authentication failures, and other security-related events.

- **_kern.log_**: The kernel log (/var/log/kern.log) contains messages generated by the Linux kernel, such as kernel errors, warnings, and hardware-related messages.

- **_dmesg_**: This file (/var/log/dmesg) contains the kernel ring buffer, which stores messages generated during the boot process and other kernel-related events.

- **_apache2 or httpd_**: These files (/var/log/apache2/access.log and /var/log/apache2/error.log for Apache, or /var/log/httpd/access_log and /var/log/httpd/error_log for some configurations) contain access and error logs for the Apache web server.

- **_mysql or mariadb_**: These files (/var/log/mysql/error.log for MySQL, or /var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log for MariaDB) contain logs for the MySQL or MariaDB database server.

- **_cron_**: The cron log (/var/log/cron.log or /var/log/cron) contains messages related to scheduled tasks managed by the cron daemon.

- **_mail.log or maillog_**: These files (/var/log/mail.log or /var/log/maillog) contain logs related to mail services, such as the Postfix or Sendmail mail servers.

## **3. How can you check who where the last connected users, what they did, when they left ?**

- You can use last command: It will display a list of recent login sessions, showing the username, terminal, IP address (if applicable), login time, and logout time (if applicable). If a user is currently logged in, it will show "(still logged in)" instead of a logout time.

## **4. What are the different metrics of health and performance of a system ? ?**

#### The health and performance of a system can be measured using a variety of metrics across different categories. Here are some of the key metrics:

- <span style="color:red;">**_CPU Utilization_**</span>: Measures the percentage of time the CPU spends executing non-idle tasks. High CPU utilization can indicate a system bottleneck.

- <span style="color:red;">**_Memory Usage_**</span>: Tracks the amount of RAM being used by processes and the system. Monitoring memory usage helps prevent out-of-memory errors and performance degradation due to excessive swapping.

- <span style="color:red;">**_Disk Usage_**</span>: Monitors the amount of disk space used by files and applications. High disk usage can lead to performance issues and may indicate the need for additional storage or cleanup.

- <span style="color:red;">**_Disk I/O_**</span>: Measures the rate of data read from and written to the disk. High disk I/O can impact system responsiveness and indicate storage bottlenecks.

- <span style="color:red;">**_Network Throughput_**</span>: Tracks the amount of data sent and received over the network interface. Monitoring network throughput helps identify network congestion and performance issues.

- <span style="color:red;">**_System Load Average_**</span>: Represents the average number of processes in the run queue over different time intervals (1, 5, and 15 minutes). High load averages may indicate a system under heavy load.

- <span style="color:red;">**_Process Performance_**</span>: Monitors individual process metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O. Identifying resource-intensive processes helps optimize system performance.

- <span style="color:red;">**_System Uptime_**</span>: Measures the duration for which the system has been running without a reboot. Long uptimes indicate system stability, while frequent reboots may indicate instability or maintenance.

- <span style="color:red;">**_Temperature and Hardware Health_**</span>: Monitors the temperature of critical hardware components such as CPU, GPU, and hard drives. High temperatures can lead to hardware failures and performance degradation.

- <span style="color:red;">**_System Logs_**</span>: Analyzes system logs for errors, warnings, and other messages that may indicate system health or performance issues.

- <span style="color:red;">**_Application-specific Metrics_**</span>: Tracks metrics relevant to specific applications or services running on the system, such as web server requests per second, database query latency, or application response time.

By monitoring these metrics, system administrators can identify performance bottlenecks, predict capacity needs, and ensure the overall health and stability of the system.

## **5. How can you check the uptime of a machine ?**

- We will use "uptime" or "w" to have more details

![alt text](/img/w-uptime.png)

- This will display the current time, how long the system has been running, the number of users currently logged in, and the system load averages for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.


## **6. How can you assess the network traffic ?**
